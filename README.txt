This is a team project by Ylonka Machado (Section 1) and Noah Tebben (Section 2)

Part descriptions:
The first part consists of reading user-inputted values and computing values such as number of zeros and ones, the smallest digit in the integer, etc.

The second part consists of reading a user-inputted string of any length and a subsequent substring to search for within the first string. This outputs a results table with character tallies (white space and regular characters) and a word count as well as a success or failure message stating whether the substring was found or not.
